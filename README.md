# Netflix Clone
I built this Netflix app as a personal challenge. I tried to make it as close as possible to the Official Netflix site, it contains user authentication using [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/), and gets the movies/tv series data from the [TMDB API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/).
